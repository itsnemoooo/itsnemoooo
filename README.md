# Hi there, I'm Nathan! 👋

</div>
Engineer and Machine Learning Enthusiast with a knack for solving complex problems through innovative solutions. I recently completed my MSc in Machine Learning at UCL, where I focused on **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and its applications in HVAC optimization. My background also includes Electrical Engineering, enriched by hands-on experience in IoT and scalable system design.

I specialize in **end-to-end development**, from building intelligent systems to deploying them on cloud platforms like **Azure** and **Google Cloud**. My expertise lies in **Reinforcement Learning**, **AI for Energy Efficiency**, and **MLOps**, and I'm passionate about combining cutting-edge AI with practical engineering solutions. 🌍

## What I'm Working On
- **Three Climate Experiment**: An innovative, deep-reinforcement-learning-based HVAC solution to optimize energy use and comfort in office spaces.
- **Sold by RL**: Agentic pricing in large-scale ecomerce websites, managing supply along with competitor price predictions.
- Exploring creative, human-AI interactions that gamify **Reinforcement Learning training**.
